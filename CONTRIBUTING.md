# Contributing to Nightingale Language

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Nightingale Language project!

## Early Development Notice

I genuinely appreciate your enthusiasm for this project. However, I want to be transparent about the current state of development:

- **Very Early Stages**: This project is in its infancy. There is currently no clear outline, roadmap, or defined goals for the language.
- **Unstable Foundation**: The project structure, language design, and implementation approach may change dramatically or be completely rewritten at any time.
- **No Contribution Guidelines Yet**: I don't have established contribution guidelines, coding standards, or a clear development process at this stage.

## Fork at Your Own Risk

If you're interested in experimenting with or building upon this project:

- Feel free to **fork** the repository and explore your own ideas
- Please understand that there are **no guarantees** about the direction this project will take
- Your fork may diverge significantly from the main project as things evolve
- I may not be able to accept pull requests at this time due to the undefined nature of the project

## Stay Updated

I encourage you to watch this repository for updates. Once the project matures and I have a clearer vision and structure, I'll update this document with proper contribution guidelines.

Thank you for your understanding and interest in Nightingale!
